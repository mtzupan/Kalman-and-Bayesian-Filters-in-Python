    "The Kalman filter belongs to a family of filters called *Bayesian filters*. Most textbook treatments of the Kalman filter present the Bayesian formula, perhaps shows how it factors into the Kalman filter equations, but mostly keeps the discussion at a very abstract level. \n",

    "That approach requires a fairly sophisticated understanding of several fields of mathematics, and it still leaves much of the work of understanding and forming an intuitive grasp of the situation in the hands of the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use a different way to develop the topic, to which I owe the work of Dieter Fox and Sebastian Thrun a great debt. It depends on building an intuition on how Bayesian statistics work by tracking an object through a hallway - they use a robot, I use a dog. I like dogs, and they are less predictable than robots which imposes interesting difficulties for filtering. The first published example of this that I can find seems to be Fox 1999 [1], with a fuller example in Fox 2003 [2]. Sebastian Thrun also uses this formulation in his excellent Udacity course Artificial Intelligence for Robotics [3]. In fact, if you like watching videos, I highly recommend pausing reading this book in favor of first few lessons of that course, and then come back to this book for a deeper dive into the topic.\n",

    "## Tracking a Dog\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with a simple problem. We have a dog friendly workspace, and so people bring their dogs to work. Occasionally the dogs wander out of offices and down the halls. We want to be able to track them. So during a hackathon somebody invented a sonar sensor to attach to the dog's collar. It emits a signal, listens for the echo, and based on how quickly an echo comes back we can tell whether the dog is in front of an open doorway or not. It also senses when the dog walks, and reports in which direction the dog has moved. It connects to the network via wifi and sends an update once a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to track my dog Simon, so I attach the device to his collar and then fire up Python, ready to write code to track him through the building. At first blush this may appear impossible. If I start listening to the sensor of Simon's collar I might read **door**, **hall**, **hall**, and so on. How can I use that information to determine where Simon is?\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep the problem small enough to plot easily we will assume that there are only 10 positions in the hallway, which we will number 0 to 9, where 1 is to the right of 0. For reasons that will be clear later, we will also assume that the hallway is circular or rectangular. If you move right from position 9, you will be at position 0.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When I begin listening to the sensor I have no reason to believe that Simon is at any particular position in the hallway. From my perspective he is equally likely to be in any position. There are 10 positions, so the probability that he is in any given position is 1/10. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's represent our belief of his position in a NumPy array. I could use a Python list, but NumPy arrays offer functionality that we will be using soon."

    "In [Bayesian statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability) this is called a [*prior*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability). It is the probability prior to incorporating measurements or other information. More completely, this is called the *prior probability distribution*. A [*probability distribution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) is a collection of all possible probabilities for an event. Probability distributions always sum to 1 because something had to happen; the distribution lists all possible events and the probability of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm sure you've used probabilities before - as in \"the probability of rain today is 30%\". The last paragraph sounds like more of that. But Bayesian statistics was a revolution in probability because it treats probability as a belief about a single event. Let's take an example. I know that if I flip a fair coin infinitely many times I will get 50% heads and 50% tails. This is called [*frequentist statistics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference) to distinguish it from Bayesian statistics. Computations are based on the frequency in which events occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "I flip the coin one more time and let it land. Which way do I believe it landed? Frequentist probability has nothing to say about that; it will merely state that 50% of coin flips land as heads. In some ways it is meaningless to assign a probability to the current state of the coin. It is either heads or tails, we just don't know which. Bayes treats this as a belief about a single event - the strength of my belief or knowledge that this specific coin flip is heads is 50%. Some object to the term \"belief\"; belief can imply holding something to be true without evidence. In this book it always is a measure of the strength of our knowledge. We'll learn more about this as we go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian statistics takes past information (the prior) into account. We observe that it rains 4 times every 100 days. From this I could state that the chance of rain tomorrow is 1/25. This is not how weather prediction is done. If I know it is raining today and the storm front is stalled, it is likely to rain tomorrow. Weather prediction is Bayesian.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice statisticians use a mix of frequentist and Bayesian techniques. Sometimes finding the prior is difficult or impossible, and frequentist techniques rule. In this book we can find the prior. When I talk about the probability of something I am referring to the probability that some specific thing is true given past events. When I do that I'm taking the Bayesian approach.\n",

You might suspect, correctly, that if you had a very long hallway with a large number of doors that after several sensor readings and positions updates we would either be able to know where Simon was, or have the possibilities narrowed down to a small number of possibilities.

For our dog tracker the system state is the position of the dog, and the state evolution is the position after a discrete amount of time has passed.\n",

But the general idea is already clear. You slide an array called the *kernel* across another array, multiplying the neighbors of the current cell with the values of the second array. In our example above we used 0.8 for the probability of moving to the correct location, 0.1 for undershooting, and 0.1 for overshooting. We make a kernel of this with the array `[0.1, 0.8, 0.1]`. All we need to do is write a loop that goes over each element of our array, multiplying by the kernel, and summing the results. To emphasize that the belief is a probability distribution I have named it `pdf`."

You don't know this, so at the next prediction you predict he is in the same spot. But the measurements tell a different story.

    "## Drawbacks and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not be mislead by the simplicity of the examples I chose. This is a robust and complete filter, and you may use the code in real world solutions. If you need a multimodal, discrete filter, this filter works.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, this filter it is not used often because it has several limitations. Getting around those limitations is the motivation behind the chapters in the rest of this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first problem is scaling. Our dog tracking problem used only one variable, $pos$, to denote the dog's position. Most interesting problems will want to track several things in a large space. Realistically, at a minimum we would want to track our dog's $(x,y)$ coordinate, and probably his velocity $(\\dot{x},\\dot{y})$ as well. We have not covered the multidimensional case, but instead of an array we use a multidimensional grid to store the probabilities at each discrete location. Each `update()` and `predict()` step requires updating all values in the grid, so a simple four variable problem would require $O(n^4)$ running time *per time step*. Realistic filters can have 10 or more variables to track, leading to exorbitant computation requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second problem is that the filter is discrete, but we live in a continuous world. The histogram requires that you model the output of your filter as a set of discrete points. A 100 meter hallway requires 10,000 positions to model the hallway to 1cm accuracy. So each update and predict operation would entail performing calculations for 10,000 different probabilities. It gets exponentially worse as we add dimensions. A 100x100 m$^2$ courtyard requires 100,000,000 bins to get 1cm accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third problem is that the filter is multimodal. In the last example we ended up with strong beliefs that the dog was in position 4 or 9. This is not always a problem. Particle filters, which we will study later, are multimodal and are often used because of this property. But imagine if the GPS in your car reported to you that it is 40% sure that you are on D street, and 30% sure you are on Willow Avenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "A forth problem is that it requires a measurement of the change in state. We need a motion sensor to detect how much the dog moves. There are ways to work around this problem, but it would complicate the exposition of this chapter, so, given the aforementioned problems, I will not discuss it further.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, if I had a small problem that this technique could handle I would choose to use it; it is trivial to implement, debug, and understand, all virtues."

  {

    "## Tracking and Control\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been passively tracking an autonomously moving object. But consider this very similar problem. I am automating a warehouse and want to use robots to collect all of the items for a customer's order. Perhaps the easiest way to do this is to have the robots travel on a train track. I want to be able to send the robot a destination and have it go there. But train tracks and robot motors are imperfect. Wheel slippage and imperfect motors means that the robot is unlikely to travel to exactly the position you command. There is more than one robot, and we need to know where they all are so we do not cause them to crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we add sensors. Perhaps we mount magnets on the track every few feet, and use a Hall sensor to count how many magnets are passed. If we count 10 magnets then the robot should be at the 10th magnet. Of course it is possible to either miss a magnet or to count it twice, so we have to accommodate some degree of error. We can use the code from the previous section to track our robot since magnet counting is very similar to doorway sensing.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we are not done. We've learned to never throw information away. If you have information you should use it to improve your estimate. What information are we leaving out? We know what control inputs we are feeding to the wheels of the robot at each moment in time. For example, let's say that once a second we send a movement command to the robot - move left 1 unit, move right 1 unit, or stand still.  If I send the command 'move left 1 unit' I expect that in one second from now the robot will be 1 unit to the left of where it is now. This is a simplification because I am not taking acceleration into account, but I am not trying to teach control theory. Wheels and motors are imperfect. The robot might end up 0.9 units away, or maybe 1.2 units. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now the entire solution is clear. We assumed that the dog kept moving in whatever direction he was previously moving. That is a dubious assumption for my dog! Robots are far more predictable. Instead of making a dubious prediction based on assumption of behavior we will feed in the command that we sent to the robot! In other words, when we call `predict()` we will pass in the commanded movement that we gave the robot along with a kernel that describes the likelihood  of that movement."

    "**If you can understand this chapter you will be able to understand and implement Kalman filters.** I cannot stress this enough. If anything is murky, go back and reread this chapter and play with the code. The rest of this book will build on the algorithms that we use here. If you don't understand why this filter works you will have little success with the rest of the material. However, if you grasp the fundamental insight - multiplying probabilities when we measure, and shifting probabilities when we update leads to a converging solution - then after learning a bit of math you are ready to implement a Kalman filter."
