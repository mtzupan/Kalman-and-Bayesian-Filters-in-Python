    "Now that we understand the discrete Bayes filter and Gaussians we are prepared to implement a Kalman filter. We will do this exactly as we did the discrete Bayes filter - rather than starting with equations we will develop the code step by step based on reasoning about the problem. \n",

    "\"One dimensional\" means that the filter only tracks one state variable, such as position on the x-axis. In subsequent chapters we will learn a more general multidimensional form of the filter that can track many state variables simultaneously, such as position, velocity, and acceleration. Recall that we used velocity in the g-h filter to get better estimates than by tracking position alone. The same is true for the Kalman filter.\n",

Testing during the hackathon confirmed this result - the sensor is 'reasonably' accurate, and while it had errors, the errors are small. Furthermore, the errors seemed to be evenly distributed on both sides of the true position; a position of 23 m would equally likely be measured as 22.9 or 23.1. Perhaps we can model this with a Gaussian.\n",

The process variance is how much error there is in the process model. We are predicting that at each time step the dog moves forward one meter. Dogs rarely do what we expect, and things like hills or the whiff of a squirrel will change his progress. If this was a robot responding to digital commands the performance would be much better, and perhaps the variance would be $\\sigma^2=.05$. These are not 'magic' numbers; the square root of the variance is the distance error in meters. It is easy to get a Kalman filter working by just plugging in numbers, but if the numbers do not reflect reality the performance of the filter will be poor.\n",

This is because with Gaussians ~99.7% of values fall within $\\pm3\\sigma$ of the mean.\n",

In subsequent chapters we will learn how to handle situations where you don't have a velocity sensor or input, so please accept this simplification for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we initialize the simulation and create 10 measurements:\n",

The variance got worse, which is what always happens during the prediction step because it involves a loss of information.\n",

To be honest, there is still quite a bit of information missing from this presentation. Following chapters will fill in the gaps. Still, let's get a feel for it by designing and implementing a Kalman filter for a thermometer. The sensor for the thermometer outputs a voltage that corresponds to the temperature that is being measured. We have read the manufacturer's specifications for the sensor, and it tells us that the sensor exhibits white noise with a standard deviation of 0.13 volts.\n",

The sensing step probably seems clear - call `volt()` to get the measurement, pass the result into `update()` method, but what about the predict step? We do not have a sensor to detect 'movement' in the voltage, and for any small duration we expect the voltage to remain constant. How shall we handle this?\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, we will trust in the math. We have no known movement, so we will set that to zero. However, that means that we are predicting that the temperature will never change. If that is true, then over time we should become extremely confident in our results. Once the filter has enough measurements it will become very confident that it can predict the subsequent temperatures, and this will lead it to ignoring measurements that result due to an actual temperature change. This is called a *smug* filter, and is something you want to avoid. So we will add a bit of error to our prediction step to tell the filter not to discount changes in voltage over time. In the code below I set `process_var = .05**2`. This is the expected variance in the change of voltage over each time step. I chose this value merely to be able to show how the variance changes through the update and predict steps. For a real sensor you would set this value for the actual amount of change you expect. For example, this would be an extremely small number if it is a thermometer for ambient air temperature in a house, and a high number if this is a thermocouple in a chemical reaction chamber. We will say more about selecting the actual value in the later chapters.\n",

On the other hand, if this is a cheap sensor it is likely it received little to no testing prior to being sold. Manufacturers typically test a small subset of their output to verify that a sample falls within the desired performance range. If you have a critical application you will need to read the specification sheet carefully to figure out exactly what they mean by their ranges. Do they guarantee their number is a maximum, or is it, say, the $3\\sigma$ error rate? Is every item tested? Is the variance normal, or some other distribution? Finally, manufacturing is not perfect.

Data sheets for electrical components often contain a section of \"Typical Performance Characteristics\". These are used to capture information that cannot be easily conveyed in a table. For example, I am looking at a chart showing output voltage vs current for a LM555 timer. There are three curves showing the performance at different temperatures. The response is ideally linear, but all three lines are curved. This clarifies that errors in voltage outputs are probably not Gaussian - in this chip's case higher temperatures lead to lower voltage output, and the voltage output is quite nonlinear if the input current is very high. \n",

You will also note that the Gaussian's height bounces up and down a little bit. If you watch closely you will see that the Gaussian becomes a bit shorter and more spread out during the prediction step, and becomes taller and narrower as the filter incorporates another measurement.\n",

The measurements  clearly indicate that the dog is changing speed but the filter has been told that it's predictions are nearly perfect so it almost entirely ignores them. I encourage you to adjust the amount of movement in the dog vs process variance. We will also be studying this topic much more in the later chapters. The key point is to recognize that math requires that the variances correctly describe your system. The filter does not 'notice' that it is diverging from the measurements and correct itself. It computes the Kalman gain from the variance of the prior and the measurement, and forms the estimate depending on which is more accurate."

Because we are relatively sure about our belief in the sensor ($\\sigma^2=5^2$) after only the first step we have changed our position estimate from 1000 m to roughly 50 m. After another 5-10 measurements we have converged to the correct value. This is how we get around the chicken and egg problem of initial guesses. In practice we would likely assign the first measurement from the sensor as the initial value, but you can see it doesn't matter much if we wildly guess at the initial conditions - the Kalman filter still converges so long as the filter variances are chosen to match the actual process and measurement variances."

However, I think it is a vital stepping stone. We started the book with the g-h filter, then implemented the discrete Bayes filter, and now implemented the one dimensional Kalman filter. I have tried to show you that each of these filters use the same algorithm and reasoning. The mathematics of the Kalman filter that we will learn shortly is fairly sophisticated, and it can be difficult to understand the underlying simplicity of the filter. That sophistication comes with significant benefits: the generalized filter will markedly outperform the filters in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter takes time to assimilate. To truly understand it you will probably have to work through this chapter several times. I encourage you to change the various constants in the code and observe the results. Convince yourself that Gaussians are a good representation of a unimodal belief of  the position of a dog in a hallway, the position of an aircraft in the sky, or the temperature of a chemical reaction chamber. Then convince yourself that multiplying Gaussians truly does compute a new belief from your prior belief and the new measurement. Finally, convince yourself that if you are measuring movement, that adding the Gaussians together updates your belief. \n",

    "Most of all, spend enough time with the **Full Description of the Algorithm** section to ensure you understand the algorithm and how it relates to the g-h filter and discrete Bayes filter. There is just one 'trick' here - selecting a value somewhere between a prediction and a measurement. Each algorithm performs that trick with different math, but all use the same logic."
